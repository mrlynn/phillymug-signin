# Mug-Signin
##User Group Sign-in MEAN Stack Example App

This app was created to facilitate a registration / signin desk for meetup groups.  Imagine you're arranging meetup events and you want to be able to have the guests hit up a link so they can sign-in / register when they show up.

The app was designed with two primary interfaces: 

One for users to sign themselves in.  


And another for someone that may be signing users in as they arrive.
